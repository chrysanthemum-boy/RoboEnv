# RoboEnv

Welcome to **RoboEnv**, a repository designed to manage and set up the environment for robotic simulation and control. This repository includes an `environment.yaml` file that specifies all dependencies and links to other essential repositories, ensuring a seamless setup for robotic development and testing.

## Repository Overview

**RoboEnv** provides a central place to:
- Set up a consistent development environment for robotic simulation.
- Install and manage dependencies required for the `sim_and_control` and `mycobot_client` repositories.
- Facilitate easy integration and usage of robotic control algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with **RoboEnv**, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- **Git**: Version control system to clone repositories.
- **Conda/Mamba**: Package manager for managing environments. Mamba is a fast, flexible, and user-friendly package manager. If you don't have Mamba installed, follow the installation instructions available [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). once mamba is istalled move to the next section.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the `roboenv` Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/VModugno/RoboEnv.git
   cd RoboEnv
   ```

2.  **Install the Conda Environment and the simulation_and_control library:**

    The environment.yaml file includes all the dependencies required for the simulation and control projects. To create the environment, run the below commands.
    ```bash
    mamba env create -f environment_ros2.yaml
    mamba activate roboenv2 # or if it does not work try conda activate roboenv2
    cd simulation_and_control
    pip install .
    ```

3.  **Using the Simulator**
    
   To ensure the simulator functions correctly, please copy the 'configs' and 'models' folders from the 'roboenv' environment into the same directory as your script. This directory is where your project's executable code is stored. The 'configs' folder contains essential configuration files that set the operational parameters for the simulator, while the 'models' folder includes the data models necessary for simulation. Placing these folders in the same directory as your script ensures that when the simulator runs, it can easily access and utilize these crucial resources, leading to a seamless operation

4.  **Connecting to the real elephant robot**  
    
    prior to use the mycobot client, there is a bug with ros2 and the new version of setuptools (see [here](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-python-setup-py/issues/41)). To build python ros2 packages, we need to replace some code in one of the python files in the mamba environment. There is a command to do this in Linux automatically below. You can run that. If you have trouble, look below this command.
    
    ```bash
    python -m site | grep -E miniforge3/envs.*?/lib/python3.11/site-packages | sed "s:,::g; s:\s::g; s:'::g" | awk '{print $1"/colcon_python_setup_py/package_identification/python_setup_py.py"}' | xargs sed -i -e "s/'from setuptools.extern.packaging.specifiers import SpecifierSet'/'from packaging.specifiers import SpecifierSet'/g"
    ```

    If you have trouble with the prior command, edit the file in a location similar to `/home/mz/miniforge3/envs/robo_env2_vm/lib/python3.11/site-packages/colcon_python_setup_py/package_identification/python_setup_py.py` and change the line with `'from setuptools.extern.packaging.specifiers import SpecifierSet'` to `'from packaging.specifiers import SpecifierSet'`.

5. **Activate the Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate roboenv2
    ```

6. **Pull Submodule (if you already cloned the repository without the submodules):**
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
